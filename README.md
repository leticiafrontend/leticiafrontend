## Hey, I'm LetÃ­cia ðŸ‘‹

I build sophisticated digital experiences with magical, unique and delightful details for the web.

I love working with startups, turning ideas into complete MVPs or developing complex products. I'm passionate about creating beautiful interfaces with a focus on user experience, thoughtful animation, accessibility, and high-performance code.

When I'm away from the keyboard, you can find me traveling the world, exploring new cultures, experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen, playing with my dog Peter (yes, inspired by Peter Parker my childhood obsession), or exploring open worlds in video games.
